								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I first became interested in computer science and game design in high school. This interest was largely inspired by games I had played at the time, such as Minecraft and Skyrim. The concept of creating my own fantasy world and narrating a captivating story motivated me to try it out for myself. After many Java tutorials about tilie-based maps using arrays and using different types of variables, I found myself more preoccupied with the more creative aspect of game-making such as music and art design.</p>
							<p>I chose to study at RMIT Vietnam because it was close to Japan, which made it convenient to travel back and forth. My interest in Japan and its culture contributed to my eventual decision of majoring in Japanese. As such, I was able to gain access to opportunities like an internship in Japan, which is benefical to the development of my Japanese.</p>
							<p>Aside from my studies in this language, I also have a minor in translating and interpreting. I have learned useful information about global discourse and studied cultural and linguistic contexts relevant to translation. Since I have free electives this year, I decided to enroll in 3D animation and Introduction to Information Technology. I expect to learn technical skills that would be applicable even in professions relative to my linguistic background. After all, we live in an age where having a decent technological background can provide a great advantage in the job market.</p>

								<h2>Ideal Job<br />
								<a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/game-designer-hopper-studio-1016">Game Designer</a></h2>
							<p>This position specializes in the design of user interface and experience, the scope of which includes game design and balance, in-game economy, difficulty progression and more. This job appeals to me as both a creative and game enthusiast, as I am able to utilize many years of my own experience to make the correct judgement in order to provide the best user experience. Of course, I would need to gain more experience looking at a game from a developer perspective in order to apply for this job, as there is a one-year prerequisite of being in a Game Designer position. In addition to that, this job requires good analytic and statistical skill in order to properly balance game mechanics and in-game economy. My current strengths are having good communication skills, understanding the mobile game market, and being detail-orientated. To further develop my skills in preparation for applying to such jobs, I will be dedicating the remainder of my electives to computer science or IT related courses to further my knowledge of game mechanics. I also think that, as game designers, we should constantly be aware of different genres of games that are released for future reference.</p>

						<h2>Project Idea</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I aim to develop a 2D, tile-based game where the character can move around and discover things in a fantasy world. It is inspired from titles such as OneShot and Undertale, which tile-based as well. These indie games did not rely on great graphics or complicated game mechanics, but rather excellent story-telling and an element of "aliveness" that is achieved through storing player decisions regardless of save files. I intend to have puzzles the player can solve and will work towards creating a fundamental story line.</p>

					<p>The digital game market is becoming increasingly bigger as games are constantly being pushed to its limit along with the exponential growth of computer processors and graphics cards. However, in this rush to push out as many games as possible, as flashy and beautiful as possible, the market has become oversaturated with similar concepts such as FPS or battle royale. In this day and age, it is not often that we see a game orientated around the story rather than the graphics or game. That is why I feel like we should have more games with an indie style, nostalgic 16-bit game with good atmosphere.</p>

					<p>I imagine that we can begin this project with making the main character sprite that the player will control. Then we can create a 2D tiling system and import some basic ground textures to test whether or not the game can render properly. Most of the terrain textures will have to be seamless in order to create the illusion that the ground is one whole texture, rather than a repeating pattern of the same tile. Next we implement a camera that will follow our player wherever it moves, as well as code the function for players to move on an x-y coordinate axis. We have to make sure the velocity of the player movement is not too fast or slow, and then finish bu binding some keys to the movement. Next, I plan to create a series of walking poses for my main sprite in order to animate the player character so it seems more lively. We can accomplish this by running through a loop of images depending on which way the character is moving. After this, I would like to work on some terrain and immovable objects, starting with walls and working my way up to more complicated terrain. Although this is a 2D game, we have to keep in mind that we are not working with a top-down view, but rather a side-view, so there will be some 3D elements that we will need to implement. For example, if the player walks behind a tree or wall, the game should know not to render the character; and if the player is in water, we can render half of the player and add a bobbing animation with water splashing to smooth out the cut of the sprite in the water. Once we have a general terrain completed, we can begin to work on interactable items and maybe an inventory. We could add item descriptions to give a bit of depth to the game. Then we can begin working on NPC's with randomly generated movement and dialogue options. By this point, we have created all the fundamental game mechanics and can begin writing a storyline and implementing different rooms for characters to roam and other rooms for puzzles. I want to create a similar game mechanic in OneShot, where items that are found can be used on puzzles and combined with other items to solve especially difficult ones. We can make the game feel more alive by adding dialogue for object interactions as well. The premise of the story will be that our main character wakes up in a trapped room of some sort and has no clue of how he got there. It feels like an overused trope but I think that it is a classic element of RPG adventure games that just make the transition from a black screen to gameplay more seamless. I think it is also a good way to let the user experience the game mechanics immediately, rather than going through tutorials.</p> 

					<p>There are many platforms with which 2D games can be made, such as Unity, GameMaker Studio, and Eclipse. Each of these programs utilize different programming languages and every one has a varying level of difficulty. Although it would depend on the skills of our group members, I would either choose between Unity or GameMaker Studio. Both of these platforms have a wide range of tutorials we can use as reference, and both have their own advantages such as scripting API and online forums that provide solutions. GameMaker studio is more of a drag-and-drop environment while Unity relies a bit more on Javascript and C#. The graphics can be made on paint or Photoshop, as should only be 16-bit and not terribly difficult to design. We can also use royalty-free pixel graphics that are available online, which will allow us to focus more of our efforts on gameplay and mechanics.</p>

					<p>The skills required for this project would depend the experience of our members, but assuming that everyone has a fundamental level of game design and math, its should be feasible to complete most of the fundamental game mechanics. It would be preferable if group members have basic knowledge of C#, which will be used for some of the core components of the game such as movement, collisions, and interactions.</p>

					<p>In the circumstance that this project is successfully completed, we can release it to platforms such as Steam for players to enjoy. We, as developers, can also take this opportunity to receive criticism which will help us grow as game designers and increase our repertoire.</p>
